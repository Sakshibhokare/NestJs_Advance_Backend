// REST full form: Representational state transafer 

// principles of REST APIs:
// 1. Client server decoupling : this means there is no other relation between client and server, it is completely decoupled 
// 2. Statelessness: this means each request needs to include all information necessary for processing it, serevr never creates any state for user, entire user management done at the client side 
// 3. Cacheability: it mean both the client and servere side has there own cache, they are completly independent of each othe, the goal is to improve the performance at the client side 
// 4. Uniform Interface : All APIs request for the same resource should look same 
// 5. Layered System:  
// 6. Code on Demand :
