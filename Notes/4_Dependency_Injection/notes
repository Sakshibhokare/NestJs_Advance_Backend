*************** 1st Lecture ********************
dependency Injection 
what is dependency Injection: when we create a class which is required multiple times with multiple other classes we need to handle the dependency injection to prevent the initiastion of that class every time. 
why it is important :

example: 
class Users{
    constructor(){
        console.log('user contructor');
    }
    public 'firstName' = 'john';
}

class Post{
    constructore(private user = new Users()){
        console.log('post constructor');
    }
}

class Page{
    constructor(private user = new Users()){
        console.log('Page constructor');
    }
}

const post = new Post();
const page= new Page(); 

Output will be 
user contructor
post contructor
user contructor
page contructor

note: here we are instanciting the class twice(user), beacuse the new intance we are creating everytime 
*********
we can do it like 
class Post{
    constructore(private user :  Users){
        console.log('post constructor');
    }
}

class Page{
    constructor(private user =  Users){
        console.log('Page constructor');
    }
}

now instead of creating the instance, we have passed as dependency 
Nest js will handle that dependency 

we will only cerate the instance once
const user = new User();


//Injecting the user as a dependency 
const post = new post (user);
const page = new page (user);

***********
NestJS automatically creates and manages their instances in a dependency injection container.

You just inject dependencies in the constructor, and NestJS handles the rest.

Example:

@Injectable()
class Users {}

@Injectable()
class Post {
  constructor(private user: Users) {}
}

why Important 
for decoupling: DI help in decoupling components and layers in an application 
Ease of testing: with Di, it make straightforward to test classes by moking there dependency 
Resuablity: Components and services design to be reused across deferent part
